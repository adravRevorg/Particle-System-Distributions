A large-scale particle simulator.

1. Thousands of particles bounce off a plane and a polygon
2. Ability to switch real-time between uniform, gaussian, and perlin distribution.
3. Pause, restart, show/hide particle paths, increase/decrease size real-time.
4. More than 10k particles can be simulated with decent frame rate.
